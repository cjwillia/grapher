1. Required Elements [40 pts; 5 pts each]

   HTML

Our main html file is in static/projectView.html. It uses tables, forms, all
that jazz. Mostly though, it's just a shell to be manipulated by our javascript.

   CSS

Our main css file is static/projectView.css. We use lots of classes and ids to
make things look nice. We also change elements' color via css.

   Robust App

As far as we know, you can't make our app do stupid things, and it never throws exceptions.

    User Experience

We put a lot thought into the different fonts and sizes of things. We tested
our app on several people to account for (tons of) non-intuitive parts of our app.

    Design Process, User Testing and Iterative Design

We have most of our model-changing code is static/clientApp.js, and most of our
visual code in static/clientCanvas.js.

    Effort

I've slept for 12 hours in the past 3 days.

    Code Design / Style

We have several objects for different purposes, like ProjectManager,
ClientProject, ClientNode, etc.
