Our project is a group project manager which allows members of a group project to represent tasks and schedules for the project as a graph.The graph shows the work flow of a group project, each node in the canvas represents a task by a member or a meeting schedule for all members.There is also a time bar in the graph showing the current time,which can notify members if a single task is approaching the deadline.

To run it, run the server side as:
node app.js
Then open the client side as:
http://localhost:8789/static/projectView.html

In the main page, create a project by name,then start to edit your group project.
