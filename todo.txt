Phillis:
- call them tasks, not nodes. Call them connectors, not edges.
- display project name in title
- make showDesc (a good-looking version of editDesc that will
  turn into a editDesc when you click on it)

Corey:
- have desc info show up on mouseover (automatically select node when you hover
  over a node in select mode)
- drag node immediately by clicking on it (fulfulled by last task)
- (css) make editDesc reasonable [DONE]
- when you're not displaying desc, display in its place a blub like
  "grapher is an application to organize group project. Click add task
   to create a new ..."
- save project button

Brian:
- (bug) can't make new projects
- right after you make a node, select the node you just added
- typing letters on editDesc will save them continuously
- enter on editDesc should do nothing
- (css) make canvas size reasonable
- edges should be directed
